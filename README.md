# Nano
Nano is a statically-typed compiled programming language. 
It's a mix of Zig, Rust, C++, D and C. It does not yet feature a working compiler.
We plan to implement a compiler in C++ to serve as a bootstrapper,
so the next versions can be implemented in Nano itself.

## The C++
We first wanted to use something like Orthodox C++, but now we will only refrain from using actual OOP.
